Drawing a line between given points is a process called interpolation.
Whilst the simplest interpolation method, linear interpolation would have drawn lines between given points, they will simply be straight, not the best interpolation of a potential curve.
Instead, Lagrange interpolation was used, using the polynomials of the given values to interpolate new points at the given time T.
These polynomials are calculated by multiplying together the subtraction the sought value x from all non-current y-values, divided the multiplication of current values of x minus subsequent values of x.
This produces a result that passes through all points given smoothly, although this polynomial is not accurate for results with large increases, as it tends to overfit.

I have included a potential "draw" function here, but could not get Visual Studio Code working nicely with OpenGL within the given time limit.
